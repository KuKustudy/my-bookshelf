/* I don't know why this file here I just copied everything the tutorial told me
   TT
   nah just kidding, this file is like feeding the app an input file, tailwind
   is like a predefined css stylesheet, we take this stylesheet as input, so 
   that we can use the predefined classes in our other files like App.js
